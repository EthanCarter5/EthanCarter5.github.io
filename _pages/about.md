This website serves as a central hub showcasing analytics work I have completed for App State Baseball. 

About Me:
======
I am an Economics major at Appalachian State University pursuing a Sports Analytics certificate, with hands-on experience applying data analysis to high-level athletic performance and competition environments. My work spans professional and collegiate sports, including roles with DraftKings as a College Football Data Scout, Inside Edge analyzing pitcher timing data for Major League clubs, and App State Baseball where I build R visualizations and develop Shiny applications to translate pitch-tracking and biomechanical data into actionable coaching insights. I am particularly interested in the intersection of data science, performance optimization, and competitive strategy, with a focus on turning complex datasets into clear, decision-ready analysis.
